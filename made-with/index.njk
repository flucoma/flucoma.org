Below are pieces of music and software that have made use of the FluCoMa tools, in additions to the official [project commissions](/commissions). Interrogating our design choices through early creative, practical use is integral to the project, and we are very excited that people outside the project team have started to use the tools for their own work. If you've used them, and would like your project to appear here, let us know on the [forum](https://discourse.flucoma.org).
