There are two sets of four commissions as part of the project, in order to ensure that the tools and ideas are subjected to some serious early interrogation from outside the team. The first wave of commissions worked with alpha versions of our first toolkit, and presented their work in autumn 2019. The second wave are working with alpha versions of the second toolkit, and are due to present their work early in 2021. 

## Concert 1
##### November 21 2019 

The first concert was generously hosted by [Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival](https://hcmf.co.uk/), at Bates Mill, Huddersfield. We were also fortunate to have the concert broadcast by BBC Radio 3's New Music Show. 

As well as videos of the performances below, produced by [Angela Guyton](http://http://www.angelaguyton.com/), you can learn more about the pieces in [presentations given by the artists](/plenaries#plenary3-composertalks).
