The project will hold five plenaries over its course, where the project team, commissioned composers and other guests come together to share work and insights on project topics. 

## Plenary 1 
##### September 20–22 2018, University of Huddersfield 

> Attendees: 
Pierre Alexandre Tremblay, Gerard Roma, Owen Green, John Burton, Rodrigo Constanzo, Richard Devine, Lauren Hayes, Daniele Ghisi, Sam Pluta, Hans  Tutschku, Olivier Pasquet, Nicolas d'Alessandro, Alex Harker, James Bradbury, Andie Brown, Sam Gillies, Frederic Dufeu, Jacob Hart 

The first plenary gave the project participants a first opportunity to come together and share thoughts about how the idea of 'fluid corpus manipulation' resonated with their practice. Much of the three days were given over to some group brainstorming sessions, as well as the introductory presentations embedded below, before an alpha version of the toolkit was workshopped on the final day. We were blessed to be joined also by Daniele Ghisi and Nicolas d'Alessandro as invited speakers, who gave us the benefit of their insights and ideas.

To coincide with the concert of the project's [first commissions](/commissions), kindly hosted by [Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival](http://hcmf.co.uk/), each of our first batch of composers shared with us how they had used FluCoMa tools in their work:
