The project will hold five plenaries over its course, where the project team, commissioned composers and other guests come together to share work and insights on project topics.

## Plenary 1
##### September 20–22 2018, University of Huddersfield

> Attendees:
 Alex Harker, Andie Brown, Daniele Ghisi, Frederic Dufeu, Gerard Roma, Hans Tutschku, Jacob Hart, James Bradbury John Burton, Lauren Hayes, Nicolas d'Alessandro, Olivier Pasquet, Owen Green, Pierre Alexandre Tremblay, Richard Devine, Rodrigo Constanzo, Sam Gillies, Sam Pluta.

The first plenary gave the project participants a first opportunity to come together and share thoughts about how the idea of 'fluid corpus manipulation' resonated with their practice. Much of the three days were given over to some group brainstorming sessions, as well as the introductory presentations embedded below, before an alpha version of the toolkit was workshopped on the final day. We were blessed to be joined also by Daniele Ghisi and Nicolas d'Alessandro as invited speakers, who gave us the benefit of their insights and ideas.

Due to covid travel restrictions, it was held online with a blend of group presentations and discussions, break-out 'rooms' as parallel chats and coding exchange, and deferred activities to alleviate the telematic fatigue.
