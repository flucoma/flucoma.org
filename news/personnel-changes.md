The FluCoMa team is mutating! For the last year, we will been joined by two research fellows in creative coding: Dr James Bradbury and Dr Ted Moore. The focus will be to strenghten the community around the questions of enabling Fluid Corpus Manipulations within their respective creative coding environment, respectively Max and SuperCollider.

Dr Gerard Roma has been offered a full time position at Leeds Trinity University, and a such will contribute to a lesser extent to the project.

We wish them all the best in their new adventures!
