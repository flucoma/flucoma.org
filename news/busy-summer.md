Between September 20th-22nd, we were delighted to welcome to Huddersfield the eight creative coders involved in the early testing and refinement of the toolboxes we are developing. We were also joined by two external specialists and, together with the project team, we had a profitable three days learning about each other, brainstorming and subjecting the project, our methodology and first software tools to some critical scrutiny. A picture of the group in action has appeared on social media [here](https://www.facebook.com/flucoma/photos/rpp.1913576528875805/2253314621568659/) and [there](https://twitter.com/flucoma/status/1043873538074120195). We are also pleased to welcome a [new team member](/#people): Jacob Hart joins us as a musicologist, doing his PhD research around the activities of our creative coders as they encounter our tools. He is supervised in his research by Dr. Frédéric Dufeu, from the [IRiMas project](https://research.hud.ac.uk/institutes-centres/irimas/). Finally, more conferences papers and softwares are now available on our [publication page](/publications).
