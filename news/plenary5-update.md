In light of the travel restrictions, we have had to postpone the concert of the premiere from February 2021 to July 2021. We decided to split the next plenary in two, with the reflexive element going forward as planned in February online. The concert and a short plenary will be held in July 2021, still at Dialogues Festival in Edinburgh, still in collaboration with the BBC.
