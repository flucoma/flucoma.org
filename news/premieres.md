We are happy to announce that the premieres of the four first commissions will be held at [Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival](http://hcmf.co.uk/) and that the concert will be recorded by the BBC for future broadcast. The event will also celebrate the release of our first toolbox. The third plenary of the project will also be held at the University of Huddersfield at the same time.
