We invite applications for a fully-funded PhD studentship in the field of musicology and analysis to join the ‘Fluid Corpus Manipulation’ team for three and a half years. The successful candidate will work on an ethnographic and analytic project, tracking and documenting the creative process of six to ten digitally fluent composers as they integrate a new toolset into their techno-creative practice. The studentship provides 100% of tuition fees and an indexed annual stipend. For more information, [download the full call here](http://www.flucoma.org/PhDinfo.pdf).
