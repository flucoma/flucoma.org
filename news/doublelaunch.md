We are happy to announce two new strands of inspiring thoughts and musics based around and intertwined with FluCoMa's toolset today:

Firstly, a preview of the seven pieces premiered last summer, remixed and re-edited by Angela Guyton. A short clip to show an overview of what ties in all the works together. We plan to release a piece every other week, starting next week with the duet of Alice Eldridge and Chris Kiefer. Watch it here:

Secondly, a new series of â€œMade with FluCoMa" articles where [Jacob Hart](/#people) explains and showcases the relation between the musicking, the underlying thinking, and the creative coding. To start with a bang, we release two today: [Oliver Pasquet](https://learn.flucoma.org/madewithflucoma/pasquet) and [Lauren Hayes](https://learn.flucoma.org/madewithflucoma/hayes), and plan to release a new one every other week.
